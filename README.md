# Drug-Discovery-using-Machine-Learning (For Breast Cancer and Alzheimer Disease)

This is a real-life Data Science and Machine Learning Project and in this Project we have built machine learning models of **Aromatase Inhibitors (Enzyme responsible for Breast Cancer)** using **ChEMBL Bioactivity Data**.

_**Target Protein for Breast Cancer in Humans = 'aromatase'**_

_**Target Protein for Alzheimers in Humans = 'acetylcholinesterase'**_

## This Project is divided into 5 Parts:

_**Part 1:**_ `Data Collection and Pre-Processing` from the ChEMBL Database on the selected target protein `"aromatase"`.

_**Part 2:**_ `Lipinski Descriptor Calculation` and `Exploratory Data Analysis`.

_**Part 3:**_ Calculated `Molecular Descriptors (the PubChem Fingerprints) using PaDel Descriptors` that are essentially quantitative description of the compounds in the dataset. Finally, we have prepared this into a dataset for subsequent model building in Part 4.

_**Part 4:**_ Built a Regression Model of Aromatase Inhibitors (Enzyme responsible for Breast Cancer) using the `Random Forest Algorithm.`

_**Part 5:**_ Compared several ML Algorithms using `LazyPredict` for building Regression Model of Acromatase Inhibitors.
